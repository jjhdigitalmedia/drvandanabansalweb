      <p>
        Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is a fertility treatment that involves
        placing sperm inside a woman's uterus to facilitate fertilization. It's
        often used when couples face difficulties with conception due to various
        factors such as low sperm count, cervical issues, or unexplained
        infertility. Here's are the process of IUI:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          1. Ovulation Monitoring: The woman's menstrual cycle is closely
          monitored to determine the optimal time for insemination. This is
          typically around the time of ovulation when the ovaries release an
          egg.
        </li>
        <li>
          2. Sperm Preparation: The sperm sample, which can be from the male
          partner or a donor, is prepared in the lab. This involves washing the
          sperm to separate the highly motile, healthy sperm from the seminal
          fluid and other debris.
        </li>
        <li>
          3. Insemination: Once the woman is determined to be ovulating, the
          prepared sperm sample is inserted directly into her uterus using a
          thin, flexible catheter. This process is usually painless and does not
          require aesthesia.
        </li>
        <li>
          4. Post-Insemination: After the procedure, the woman may be advised to
          rest for a short period before resuming normal activities. Some
          doctors may prescribe medications such as progesterone to support the
          uterine lining and increase the chances of successful implantation.
        </li>
        <li>
          5. Pregnancy Test: About two weeks after the insemination, a pregnancy
          test is performed to determine if the procedure was successful.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        IUI is generally less invasive and less expensive than other assisted
        reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), but its
        success rates can vary depending on factors such as the woman's age, the
        quality of the sperm, and any underlying fertility issues. It's often
        recommended as a first-line treatment for couples with mild fertility
        problems before considering more intensive procedures like IVF.
